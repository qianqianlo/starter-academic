Hi! Iâ€™m a NLP algorithm engineer at Alibaba Artificial Intelligence Governance Laboratory ([AAIG](https://s.alibaba.com/aaig)), Alibaba Group, advised by [Dr. Longtao Huang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EQDfV9cAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). Prior joining Alibaba, I received my M.S. Degree from Georgia Institute of Technology, where I was advised by [Prof. Sehoon Ha](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~sha9/). I also worked closely with [Prof. Dhruv Batra](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dbatra/) and [Prof. Woon-Hong Yeo](https://www.me.gatech.edu/faculty/yeo).

# My research interest lies in developing generalized, trustworthy machine learning algorithms via Meta/Transfer Learning, Adversarial Learning approaches, and their applications in NLP, CV and robotics.
My research interest lies in Deep Reinforcement Learning, Meta Learning, and their applications in CV, NLP and Robotics.
