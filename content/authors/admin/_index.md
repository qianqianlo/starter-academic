Hi! Iâ€™m a second-year Electrical and Computer Engineering master student at Georgia Institute of Technology. I'm advised by [Prof. Sehoon Ha](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~sha9/), working on Embodied Visual Navigation based on machine learning. I'm also working closely with [Prof. Woon-Hong Yeo](https://www.me.gatech.edu/faculty/yeo), solving biosphysical signal classification problem using machine learning strategies. Prior coming to Georgia Tech, I received my B.Eng from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in China, where I spent a great time working with [Prof. Hai-Tao Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=y089Rj8AAAAJ&hl=en).

My research interest lies in Computer Vision, Deep Reinforcement Learning, and Meta Learning, focusing on the applications in robotics.
